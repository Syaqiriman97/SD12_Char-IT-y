# Char-IT-y-Website-System
A Char-IT-y app which is a website system that is being developed to assist those who are hungry, homeless, or in need of assistance. This application can be accessed by everyone who needs it. Anyone with a problem can complete their biodata form and submit it to the system through the application. People who have a lot of money can also use this app to donate to charity. Most people nowadays always spread a poster about a bank account number and ask for charity, but people do not know if the bank account number is legit or not, so with this system, the user will have more confidence in the money they transfer, and the funds will go directly to someone who truly needs assistance based on the data we have. It will also assist the NGO in locating and locating people who are truly in need, particularly in an emergency, such as when someone is involved in a natural disaster and requires quick assistance with shelter and food.
